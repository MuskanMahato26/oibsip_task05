SALES PREDICTION

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people
will buy based on factors such as the amount spend to advertise product, 
the segment of people advertise for, or the platform advertising on about product.

Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist
to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of 
advertising their product. So lets start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.
